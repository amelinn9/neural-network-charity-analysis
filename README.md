# Neural Network Charity Analysis

## Overview



## Results
### *Data Preprocessing*
**Target variable**
  -	The variable `IS_SUCCESSFUL` was considered as the target for this model.
  
**Feature variables**
  -	The variables `APPLICATION_TYPE`, `AFFILIATION`, `CLASSIFICATION`, `USE_CASE`, `ORGANIZATION`, `STATUS`, `INCOME_AMT`, `SPECIAL_CONSIDERATIONS`, and `ASK_AMT` were considered to be the features for this model.

**Non-target/features**
  -	The variables `EIN` and `NAME` were neither targets nor features, and were removed from the input data.


### *Compiling, Training, and Evaluating the Model*
1. These were the neurons, layers, and activation functions selected for the neural network model:  
  - Hidden layer 1 = 80 neurons, Activation = ReLU  
  - Hidden layer 2 = 30 neurons, Activation = ReLU  
  - Output layer Activation = Sigmoid  

2. I was not able to achieve the target model performance.
